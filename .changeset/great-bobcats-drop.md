"azdo-npm-auth": patch

We're moving away from release-it and towards using Changsets instead for versioning. See context here: https://github.com/johnnyreilly/azdo-npm-auth/issues/46

All versions prior to this one were published using release-it. From this version onwards, versions will be published using Changesets. Versions 1.6.0 - 1.8.0 had issues in their publishing process and are being skipped from the version history as they did not contain app code changes.
